# GameEngine2D

## Overview
GameEngine2D is a simple and customizable 2D game engine built using Java. It is designed to help developers quickly prototype 2D games with basic features such as game object management, rendering, and frame control. The engine provides core functionality such as a game loop, object updates, and smooth rendering with customizable frame rates.

## Features
- **Game Loop**: A dedicated thread that controls game updates and rendering.
- **Game Object Management**: Allows the addition and management of game objects (e.g., `GameObject` class).
- **Input Handling**: Supports keyboard and mouse input through listeners.
- **Rendering**: Uses `Graphics2D` for efficient rendering of game objects on a double-buffered canvas.
- **Frame Control**: Customizable frames per second (FPS) for controlling the game's speed.
- **Thread Synchronization**: Ensures thread safety when updating and rendering game objects.

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher.
- A basic understanding of Java and object-oriented programming concepts.
